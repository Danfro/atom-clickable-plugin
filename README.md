# atom-clickable-plugin

This *atom-clickable-plugin* does provide some common [clickable](https://github.com/bhdouglass/clickable) tools needed to build and run click packages for [Ubuntu Touch](https://ubports.com/) from within [Atom](https://atom.io/) editor. Visit Atoms package site for this plugin [atom-clickable-plugin](https://atom.io/packages/atom-clickable-plugin).

_**Note: Since atom development has been stopped, there is no use for keeping plugins for atom alive. This repository will be archived for that reason.**_

## Credits
This is a fork of the (now unmaintained) original [atom-build-clickable](https://github.com/sverzegnassi/atom-build-clickable) plugin for Atom by `@sverzegnassi`. Many thanks to you for this great work!

## Prerequisites

This package requires [clickable](https://github.com/bhdouglass/clickable) version 7 to be installed and available on your system. For detailed instructions on installing and usage please visit [clickable docs](https://clickable-ut.dev/)

**Note: Clickable version 6 is no longer supported since v2.0.0 of this plugin. To keep using clickable version 6 please use an older version.**

**Note: Clickable.yaml MUST use valid yaml format. Using JSON format will prevent the clickable tools to be enabled since Atom automatically checks the format on startup.**
